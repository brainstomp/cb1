Start by installing CB1 Debian to your CB1 or a MicroSD card.
Log in as root.

Note that SSHd is enabled by default. If you want to make things a little easier get the IP address of the system and then SSH into it.

Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file to use the debian default repositories:
   nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   
My sources.list file looks like this:

   deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free
   deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib non-free
   deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main contrib non-free
   
Update the APT list:
   apt update

Upgrade any packages that need to be upgraded:
   apt upgrade

Install xOrg
   apt install xorg

Install gnome
   apt install gnome
   
You can now start xWindows
   startx
